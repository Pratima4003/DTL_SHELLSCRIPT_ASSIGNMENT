Ways to Tackle Global Warming
The time is now to do something to prevent global warming, otherwise, it will be irreversible.
Electricity and transportation contribute largely to global warming, so we must begin there.
It is important to note that there is no silver bullet and we must all come together to tackle global warming as a whole.
Every home, business, industry, individual effort is required to tackle this crisis.

As coal produces tons of Carbon dioxide annually, we need to find ways to clean up coal.
We can also tackle global warming by beginning with putting agriculture in the system.
We must encourage farmers to adapt to greener farming practices.
For instance, they must till land less often, and plant trees on vacant land.

Moreover, the same regime needs to be applied to other industrial producers of carbon dioxide.
For instance, the transportation industry of cars, trucks, planes and more produce 28% of the carbon dioxide emissions.
Thus, we must reduce these emissions by enhancing the fuel efficiency of the vehicles.
Also, it is high time we got rid of oil and gasoline-based fuels and opt for greener alternatives.

On an individual level also, we must work to adopt a greener and healthier lifestyle.
Try to drive less and walk more or take public transport.
Get into the habit of recycling and avoid unnecessary wastage of goods.
Save electricity by switching off appliances when not in use.
 Most importantly, plant a tree as a single tree can absorb one ton of carbon dioxide in its lifetime.
 Thus, remember, the change begins with you.
